Welcome to our biodiversity game! It is stationed in and around the Arboretum. The game consists of following hints and QR-codes through a route, answering questions about species, biodiversity and connected topics. If you want to start, find the stake near the place where the insects can check in over winter!
For more/official info about the park, take a look at the official web page.
