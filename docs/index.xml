Welcome to our biodiversity game! It is stationed in and around the Arboretum. The game consists of following hints and QR-codes through a route, answering questions about species, biodiversity and connected topics. If you want to start, find the stake near the place where the insects can check in over winter!
The game is made by four students at NTNU in collaboration with the botanical garden.
For more/official info about the park, take a look at the official web page.</description>

      <description>Welcome! Here we have a question about alien and invasive species!
Sitkagran (Sitka spruce) is an alien species in Norway. Is it unwanted here, and if so, why? - Unwanted. They are fragile and die when we plant them in norwegian territory.  - Unwanted. It spreads easily, dominates natural species and prevents other species to grow on the ground close to the trees.  - Barely wanted. The seeds spread easily and nourish the fields they land on, making Sitkagran a positive contribution to the biodiversity.</description>
