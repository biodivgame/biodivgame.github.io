Welcome! Here we have a question about bugs!

A tree stump placed here reveals the interesting patterns left by the longhorn beetle / trebukk larvae as it borrows beneath the bark. Insect lover Frode Ødegaard believes it is most likely the species Semanotus undatus, which will leave a hatching hole of approx. 5 mm and can be found as adults on the wood in May.


#### How much of the birch forests of Finnmark was eaten by butterfly larvae the summer of 2019?
