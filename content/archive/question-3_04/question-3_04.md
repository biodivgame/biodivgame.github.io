Welcome! Here we have a question about alien and invasive species!

#### There are many foreign species. How should you treat foreign plants, trees, etc..?


##### - <center> [Unwanted. They are fragile and die when we plant them in norwegian territory.](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-3_04_false/wrong-answer/) </center>
##### - <center> [Be cautious! Read about them and make sure they are wanted in your area and will cause no harm before deciding what to do.](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-3_04_correct/right-answer/) </center>
##### - <center> [Plant them! Nature can handle it, therefore the best is to return them to nature.](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-3_04_false/wrong-answer/) </center>
##### - <center> [Try to taste the plant or the leaves of the tree. If it tastes weird, don't plant it, but if it tastes ok, you are free to plant it.](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-3_04_false/wrong-answer/) </center>
