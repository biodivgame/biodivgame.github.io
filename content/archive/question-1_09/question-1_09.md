Welcome! Here we have a question about some mammals!

A very interesting development has unfolded in the garden. As with all botanical gardens, many of the trees are not indigenous. Also here, much of the arboretum showcases trees from the northern hemisphere, leading up to the arctic. As a result, there is a small stand of Siberian pine trees. A food source for the over-wintering Siberian nutcracker / nucifraga, these birds have begun to stay longer than expected. This has had a knock-on effect, as through their foraging they have begun to spread the seeds and saplings of the Siberian pine is now coming up along the coast of Lade.


#### Which bird is this pine tree, Pinus cembra, a primary source of food for?
