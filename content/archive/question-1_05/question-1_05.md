Welcome! Here we have a question about Lichen. See if you can find them in the trees around you!

Here you will find a variety of lichen inhabiting the trees. According to botanist Vibekke Vange, the tree stand in the Arboretum is facing north and probably gets a fairly humid microclimate, which favors various lichens. There are three main types of lichen to be found. From the leaf-like foliose lichen, the species Hypogymnia physodes, Parmelia sulcate and Platismatia glauca are visible. While the bushy fruticose type features Ramalina farinose and Pseudevernia furfuracea, and two hanging lichens in the genus of Usnea and Bryoria. And lastly, there is one crustose type, a bryophyte called Ulota crispa s.lat.


#### On which of these can lichen make their home? (grow on)
