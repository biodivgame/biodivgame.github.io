Welcome! Here we have a question about trees!

Sadly, several trees in the garden are being affected by fungus infections. The botanists theorise the infections may come as a consequence of global warming, as the slightly higher temperature is giving the fungi an advantage over the trees. When some trees had to be felled to avoid the spread, the garden had sculptor Oliver Vogt create animals for the gardens from the remaining trunks.


#### How many species of trees are there in the world?
