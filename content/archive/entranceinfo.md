Welcome to our biodiversity game! 
It is stationed in and around the Arboretum.
The game consists of following hints and QR-codes through a route, answering questions about species, biodiversity and connected topics.
If you want to start, find the stake near the place where the insects can *check in* over winter!

The game is made by four students at NTNU in collaboration with the botanical garden and is meant to be an offer to international visitors.

For more/official info about the park, take a look at [the official web page](https://www.ntnu.edu/museum/ringve-botanical-garden).

Here is a rough map of the route, in case you struggle to find the stakes.
