Welcome! Here we have a question about fungi and mushrooms!

#### Why are fungi/mushrooms important for nature and biodiversity?

##### - <center> [Some species break down organic elements, such as dead plants or trees, and work as natures "recylcer" to bring nutrients back into nature.](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-2_08_correct/right-answer/) </center>
##### - <center> [Some species act as food for animals, and the animals aid them to reproduce.](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-2_08_correct/right-answer/) </center>
##### - <center> [Some species act as the "middle man" between plants and the soil, extracting nutrients from the soil trading with the plants.](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-2_08_correct/right-answer/) </center>
##### - <center> [Some species can be used for research purposes in medicine (e.g. to construct antibiotics).](https://biodivgame.github.io/archive/question-2_08_correct/right-answer/) </center>
